  storyText: "As you're patrolling the outside corridors, you spot something out
    of place in the corner of your eye. \n\nDo you go off track and investigate or
    do you ignore it and continue what you are doing?\n\nWhat should you  do?\n1.
    Go investigate, it could be a potential invader.\n2. Ignore it, it's probably
    nothing and you don't want to get in trouble for straying away from your post. "
